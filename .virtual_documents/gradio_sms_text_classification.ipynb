    Perform SMS classification using a pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization and Linear Support Vector Classification.

    Parameters:
    - sms_text_df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing 'text_message' and 'label' columns for SMS classification.

    Returns:
    - text_clf (Pipeline): Fitted pipeline model for SMS classification.

    This function takes a DataFrame with 'text_message' and 'label' columns, splits the data into
    training and testing sets, builds a pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization and Linear Support Vector
    Classification, and fits the model to the training data. 
    The fitted pipeline is returned to make future predictions.

    - str: A message indicating whether the text message is classified as spam or not.

    This function takes a text message and a pre-trained pipeline model, then predicts the
    spam/ham classification of the text. The result is a message stating whether the text is
    classified as spam or not.
